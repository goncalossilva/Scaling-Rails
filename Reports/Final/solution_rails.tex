\subsection{Methodology}
The main focus regarding Ruby on Rails itself was to improve the current tools for profiling and benchmarking applications. Motivating the adoption of the soon to be released version of this framework---Rails 3---by the community was also a goal regarding this component. Since the current version of Rails is still 2.3, minor tweaks were explored to improve this versions' performance.
