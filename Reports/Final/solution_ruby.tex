\subsection{Methodology}
The main focus was on the latest version of the official Ruby interpreter, being divided into three core activities. First of all, determining the real benefits of upgrading to the latest Ruby version, 1.9. If the upgrade was proven worthy, focus would shift towards improving YARV's GC by increasing its flexibility. After that, Ruby's profiling and information retrieval capabilities were enhanced.
